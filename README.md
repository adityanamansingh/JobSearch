# JobSearchWordCloud
Intended to scrape job description information from websites such as: Indeed, Monster, etc. and analyze input in order to identify potential "buzzwords" that should be utilized in resume writing.

Ideally, the scraped information should be filtered, because job websites don't always match skillset. If a job is a front-end SWE job, but I prefer back-end, I should be able to blacklist words and phrases related to the front-end so that my word cloud isn't incorrectly populated with buzzwords that may not relate to jobs that I am applying for. There should also be a way to identify duplicates between job description websites, if Indeed and Monster both display the same job, the words in their descriptions will be double counted. In addition, the final word cloud itself should be filtered to avoid unneccessary information. For instance, almost all of these job descriptions will include words like: software, science, and, is, etc. If the words aren't helpful information, they should be omitted as much as possible.

I also wish to expand the application of the web scraping to identify jobs that I may be qualified for. Perhaps cross-referencing my resume and skills with the job decriptions and providing weights to each similarity. For instance, if the job posting is not an internship, it should automatically be a 0% match because it wouldn't be ideal or probable for me to secure a full-time job in college. Soft skills should probably carry a weight, but a match with a programming language should probably carry more weight as I am much more likely to be hired for a job that can leverage my established technical skillset.
